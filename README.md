# Whalescan

Vulnerability scanner for windows containers.

## Getting Started


```
git clone https://github.com/saira-h/whalescan

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
```

## Overview

Whalescan performs several benchmark checks, as well as checking for CVEs. This tool can be used as part of a windows
container review on local copies of the containers, and on the host itself to enhance security

* Container checks 

    * Checks if containers are stored under C: drive - this could raise issues if there is a DoS attack, 
    filling up the C: drive and making the host unresponsive
    * Checks if container is running as a process or hyper-v. Hyper-v isolation offers enhanced security of containers
    * Checks if there are any pending updates in the containers, and if so, how to update.

* Image checks
    * Checks for unsafe commands being used in the dockerfile, for example docker ADD instead of docker COPY. 
    * Checks if hash verification is being performed on any files downloaded.
    * Checks if any vulnerable packages are on the container, and pulls relevant CVE information
    * Checks if .NET version being used is End Of Life
    * Checks if Docker Engine is updated, and if not, gathers a list of CVEs for the version being used

* Checks permissions of docker configuration files 
* Checks if additional devices have been mapped to containers
